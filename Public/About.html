    <h3>About Me</h3>
    
    <p>My name is Peter van der Sluis, 26 years old, living in the Netherlands.<br>
        I'm a tech-enthousiast with a love for the outdoors and I won't say no to a party when invited to one.<br>
        I have been working in the IT industry for 5 years currently. <br> 
        Recently, I've started to dig into web development and while it's a new challenging topic, I am enjoying it.<br></p>
